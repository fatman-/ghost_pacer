# Ghost Pacer - The Story Behind

Running, I can say, is one of those things that has changed my life.

One of the things, that I have learnt as a runner: to improve your pace you need a constant reminder of your current pace, along with the desired pace that you want to improve yourself upto. Auditory aid apps do a poor job of solving this gap, and it is very uncomfortable to keep taking your phone out of your arm pocket, for a visual aid, while you are running. I felt these pain points needed to be addressed, and HackIndia provided a perfect in with providing everything I needed for the same: Pebble + Food. :-)
